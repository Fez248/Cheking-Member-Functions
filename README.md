# Cheking-Member-Functions

This program checks for a function in a struct and acts acordingly. Uses the techinque of SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error) to continue with the programm instead of producing a hard error.
In this example checks for the function foo() but it can we modified to check for whatever function you need, fell free to use it.
