# Cheking-Member-Functions

This program checks for a function in a struct and acts accordingly. Uses the technique of SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error) to continue with the program instead of producing a hard error.
In this example checks for the function foo() but it can be modified to check for whatever function you need, feel free to use it.
